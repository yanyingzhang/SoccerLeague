    <h3>How Soccer Works</h3>
    <p>Soccer (or football, if you're not American) is by far the most popular sport in the world. Tens of thousands of fans regularly show up for games played in stadiums on every continent except Antarctica, 
        where they still play but the crowds are rather sparse. For major international matches, worldwide television viewers can number in the hundreds of millions. 
        From its rough and tumble origins to the current crop of multimillionaire celebrity players, "the beautiful game" has thrilled and captivated sports fans for more than 100 years. 
        Learn how to play soccer, where it came from and some tricks to win the game.</p>
    <p>Because soccer is a very simple game at its core, many cultures have claimed to have invented it. Games involving teams, balls and some kind of battle over territory have existed in various cultures worldwide since prehistory. 
        Some of them allowed players to carry or throw the ball, while some were brutally violent. The origins of the modern game of soccer can be traced to Britain. 
        There, some holidays were celebrated with mass games played in the streets in which young men from rival villages would strive to steal a ball and carry it to a certain place or goal. 
        These were raucous affairs with hundreds of players, no rules and much damage to the players and village property.</p>
